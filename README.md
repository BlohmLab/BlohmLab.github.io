## Welcome to the ViKinG Lab Github site

This is the [Blohm Lab](http://www.compneurosci.com/) Github site. We're the computational Vision and Kinematics Group (ViKinG) at Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada. This is where you can find code and tutorials from the lab and from the Computational Sensory-Motor Neuroscience summer school (CoSMo).
